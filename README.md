# Ansible course

These files are for use in my Ansible Tower course.
They are example files, written for educational purposes and not fit for production use. 

You don't need Motivation, just do it.

## Quick Start
1. Install ansible tower I guess?
2. It would probably be good if this had a link to the original course


## Usage
1. See the quick start
